Introduction
============

.. ADDITIONAL CONTENT START

Documentations in Sphinx can be parsed into doctree_ (In other words, Abstract Syntax Tree), all contents of documents are parsed into node of this tree. The :ref:`ext` collects snippets (doctree nodes) during the build phase of Sphinx, and provide a :ref:`cli` for your accessing.

For more details, please refer to :doc:`intro`

Then, add the extension name to ``extensions`` configuration item in your conf.py_:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = [
             # …
             'sphinxnotes.snippet',
             # …
             ]
